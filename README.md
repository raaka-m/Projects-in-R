# Projects-in-R

Here are two projects I've completed in R.

The first project is "Predicting Respondent Income from NYC Housing Conditions and Demographic Features." I built linear regression models that predicted income from different housing factors in NYC in R.

The second project is "Evaluating Room Occupancy Classifiers." I utilized binary classification tools to evaluate room occupancy classifiers in R.
